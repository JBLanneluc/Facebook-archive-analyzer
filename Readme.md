# Facebook Archive Analyzer

Little application running on Python3 with a simple shell as an interface.
This application is about visualizing locally some statistics about your use of messenger.
Of course, nothing is sent, everything is local and stays on your computer.
We also worked on a profiling part, which only works for french discussions though.

## Exemple of use
First, you have to download your archive containing all your data from Facebook. All that is necessary are the messages, so you don't have to ask for all the other information.

Then, just uncompress you archive, launch the app and write down the full path to the root directory of your uncompressed archive.

To launch the app, just start the main file :

```
python3 main.py
```

And have fun !
